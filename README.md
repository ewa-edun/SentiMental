# 🧠💜 SentiMental

> *“It never happened… but it still makes you cry.”*

SentiMental is a memory simulator that uses AI to generate **fictional nostalgic memories** based on photos or text inputs. It's an experiment in **hallucinated emotion** — testing the edge where artificial intelligence meets deeply human feeling.

Built for the **AI vs H.I. Hackathon by CS Girlies**, SentiMental explores the soulful side of machine learning: not just what AI can *do*, but what it can *make us feel*.

## 💡 Features

## 🤯 Why It Matters

Nostalgia is more than memory — it’s emotion, imagination, longing. These are *human* things. SentiMental doesn't just automate tasks — it **mimics humanity**, and in doing so, questions what it means to remember, to feel, and to be.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. User uploads an image or enters a short journal entry.

4. The generated story is displayed, with optional:

   * Voice narration via ElevenLabs
   * Remix options for emotional variety
   * Cry rating (text sentiment analysis)

## 🧗 Challenges

* Prompt engineering for emotional realism
* Tone balance: poetic without sounding generic or uncanny
* Latency for TTS rendering
* Solo-built in under 16 hours — rapid decisions, tight execution
